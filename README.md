This is a small project aimed at learning a bit more about Networks and Networking.
I'm doing this while I practice and learn stuff for the CCNA exam.

The idea is to create a single .pkt file (Packet Tracer file) which contains a single network I build upon.
I'll loosely follow through Jeremy's IT Lab for the CCNA:

...and add new machines (rooters, switches, etc) as I see fit, in order to keep on par with the lessons.
In the end, I'll have a complex (enough) network, which will showcase most aspects within the syllabus.

- Updated Packet Tracer to 8.2.1

- Created empty Git Repository inside /home/ricardo/PLAYGROUND/PacketTracerProject

- Added this README.md file with a short introduction and these notes

- Added example file to the repository (test)

- Added the GitSteps.md, because I can't be assed to remember those commands, nor repeatedly web search

- Remover the example file

- Added Sketch1.pkt, Main.pkt, Sketch1.png & MainTable.ods

- Sketch1.pkt holds a specific Packet Tracer step/practice. Main.pkt is the main file holding the Network

- Sketch1.png has an image file of a specific table state. MainTable.ods is that main Table (Excel)

- Idea: Perhaps use Git Branches to keep practice Networks (thus practicing a bit with Git)

- Added a couple of machines to my network (still working with one area)

- Gave the diagram some pretty coloring. Greyed the image table as well

- Checked out the ARP PDU, and the ARP tables for all devices. After a couple of PINGs, it all fell into place.
